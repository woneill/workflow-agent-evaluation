# workflow-agent-evaluation
Hackathon project evaluating various OSS tools that work similar to Yahoo Pipes, IFTTT, or Zapier


Alas poor Yahoo Pipes! I used to use them, Horatio...

Sure, you can use IFTTT or Zapier for making workflows like good old Yahoo Pipes but there's nothing better than running a service yourself where YOU get to decide when to pull the plug on it! This project will be a quick comparison of some alternatives that can be run locally. I'm thinking of [Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn), [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/), [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/), [Beehive](https://github.com/muesli/beehive).... any others?
